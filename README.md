Footer In React

I want to create a footer in react and first I had to setup nodejs in my laptop

Steps to set up Nodejs
1. download nodejs on nodejs.org
2. choose the LTS version which is the recommended. Node.js offers two versions: LTS(Long Term Support) and Current. LTS is more stable and suitable for production environments.
3. Run the installer : once the installer is downloaded, run it and follow the installation prompts. Use the defaults options as they are.
4. Verify Installation: after the installation is complete, verify that Node.js and npm(Node Package Manager) are installed correctly by opening terminal or command prompt and run the below commands:

   node -v (this command display the installed version of Node.js)

   npm -v  (this command display the installed version of npm)

   npm install -g npm@latest (this command will update npm to the latest version globally)

After the steps you are ready to run your code in react.
